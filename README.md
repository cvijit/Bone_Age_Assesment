Bone age assessment based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks


Bone Age Assessment (BAA) is a medical test undertaken to identify the difference between a childâ€™s skeletal bone age and chronological age, and the disparity between the results will often suggest either hormonal or skeletal system development anomalies. The estimation of paediatric bone age using the radiological dataset comparing with the standard hand atlas can help in determining hormonal or endocrinological diseases and forethought on the paediatric orthopaedic surgeries. The study proposes a highly fine-tuned deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) than the tedious traditional methods from previous work, that significantly improve BAA evaluations. We find that using the effective pre-trained VGGNet approach for this medical image classification, will be able to surpass all the other recent approaches and achieve the top accuracy. Tests are then performed to evaluate whether the use of full-hand x rays or segmented regions of interest is more efficient, and comparisons are made with various CNN models. The analysis shows that the proposed method will enhance the model accuracy exceptionally.
